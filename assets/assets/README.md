# 04-Code-Quiz-
Homework 4 timed coding quiz


The HTML file consists of a few elements

    On line 8 a css style sheet located at ./assets/style.css is linked to the file

    On line 19 JQuery is linked to the file

    On line 20 a javascript file located at ./assets/script.js is linked to the file


    Lines 14-16 create three seperate div tags. Line 14 creates a container to hold the quiz elements. Line 15 will contain the timer function. Line 16 will contain the function yielding the results of the quiz.

    The entire Javascritpt file has descriptive tags explaining the process.

  Below is the original task assignment:

  "GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score"

    This code is to be continued, the last push made my corret/incorrect appear but broke my code. Now the first question is not displayed. I made progress in other direcctions soI pushed my code so it was updated with my most recent thoughts.
